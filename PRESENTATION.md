# Gastronolab
Gastronomic cooking app project for professionals and education

With this project, i'd like to develop a mobile app and a website, usable on every supports (iOS, Android, web).
The basement idea is to create an app HUB where users could find everything they need for cooking.
The alpha version (only french) is developped on Excel and adapted to web app with the website Open As App.

Through this project, i want to share knowledge about catering and gastronomic cooking, to allow people to cook like gastronomic chefs, at home or wherever they want.

In this project, we can find three paths :
- The cooking book,
- The culinary dictonary,
- The diet app

Each path is an app, so we have here a HUB called "GastronoLab".

To get more information about each app, read the files you'll find in GastronoLab Wiki with the name of each app.

Thanks for reading !
